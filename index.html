       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
      
       <p>As a current student of the Year Up program at Seattle Central College, my main goal is to find and pursue a career in the Software or Application development field. My dream since I was a child has been to be in the Game Developer field, and I still actively pursue that goal in my daily life. I am confident of the passion that I feel towards the subjects that interest me in even the slightest.
       </br></br>
        I am working towards developing the skills required for me to strive towards my goals and passions as I practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Unity Engine. My future goals are to develop my skills in Blender and Unreal Engine as well. I am very driven to fulfill my needs to succeed in all of these tasks and look forward to bringing my creativity and passion to the field.
      </br></br>
        My talents are that I have the ultimate drive and ambition to pursue anything that I set my mind to with great amounts of tenacity. My other talents include my experience in developing software modifications, my experience in cooperating with a team to bring large projects to life, and my experience in my memorization skills. I also am quick to pick up things that I am taught and use my taught skills to the best of my ability and am an efficient and quick learner.
      </br></br>
        I am extremely flexible and passionate about any situation I am put into and any goals set before me. My dedication to anything that I set my mind to has shined brightly throughout the years of my life and has shown no signs of stopping. </p>
